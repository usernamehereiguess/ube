# UBE - untitled bullethell experiment
this is an HTML port of a scratch game I made, called UBE or Untitled Bullethell Experiment, using the PenguinMod Packager to make it nicer. the original game is here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1213389035/ (thanks for playing, and enjoy :D)
ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL SOUNDS USED ARE FROM THE SCRATCH LIBRARY AND SOME HAVE BEEN MODIFIED. THEY DO NOT BELONG TO ME. ALL SPRITES WERE CREATED BY ME ON THE SCRATCH EDITOR.
